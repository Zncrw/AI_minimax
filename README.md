<h1>AI_minimax</h1> 

<h2>About project:</h2> 
<p>In this project i want to program simple AI bot to play tic-tac-toe game on 3x3 gaming board.
AI is using minimax algoritm to find out the best move posible and then perform this move. Player should not
be able to beat this simple AI in this game, best posible outcome for user is draw.</p>
<h3>About minimax algoritm:</h3>
<p>Minimax algoritm, is used in strategic game between two players. Algoritm is building decision tree and minimalizing/maximalixing the outcome. This algoritm is mostly used in game development.</p>
 <h4>How algoritm works?:</h4>
 <ol>
   <li>Try moves</li>
   <p>Algoritm generates every posible move in curent state and try it</p>
   
   <li>Evaluate</li>
   <p>For every posible move evaluate function gets "score" to determine the best move</p>

   <li></li>
   
 </ol>
  
</p>
